# Crappy_Birds_Game
A simple, fun and, interactive game made in C++.  

## Overview

Crappy Birds is a computer game featuring a frog and a flock of birds called “crappy birds”. They are crappy since they are continuously dropping rocks and fruits. The frog has to save himself from rocks but has to take fruits in order to increase score. The frog will also come across a cactus and a large piece of rock. If the frog bumps into any of those, he will die on the spot and the game will be over. There are also bees coming out of a hive which the frog will encounter towards the end of game. If the frog eats the hive completely, he will win!
